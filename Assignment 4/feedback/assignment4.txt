For q7 on line 8 the comparison will always be true. (short of writing Num = int on line 4) 

Instead of setting up a comparison that can't fail it is more common to 
write :

while True:

and then the break statement will get us out when necessary.
 
Your conditional check on line 16. Num.isalpha is not doing anything because it 
should be Num.isalpha().
You won't get an error because all no zero values are True in python for 
Booleans. 
Your code is the same as writing:

elif(True and Num == 'q')

changing it to Num.isalpha() will make it run as intended but the isalpha() check is unnecessary
as 'q' is a letter and so if the input is not alphabetical Num=='q' will fail anyways.

Your code is very good, I am just mentioning these as an aside.


Question 8
==============

If I put in 0 or 1 it should return 1. Apart from that it's very good.
