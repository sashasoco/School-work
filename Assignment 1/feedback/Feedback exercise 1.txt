Your code is very good, in program 4 line 9, you don't need to use number3 = int(number3) as number3 was
created by adding two ints. Similar on Question 8

Program 7, line 5, I would be careful about using an int as the price is seldom an integer input. 

Could you upload the code for programs 6 and 7 on page 174
